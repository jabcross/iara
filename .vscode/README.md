# VSCode Environment Configuration

This workspace is configured to automatically source the `.env` file to provide access to Spack libraries and tools.

## How it works

1. **Shell Configuration**: The `.bash_profile` automatically sources `.env` when you log in
2. **VSCode Terminals**: The `terminal.integrated.shellArgs.linux` setting ensures new terminals source `.env`
3. **Portable Setup**: No hardcoded paths in VSCode settings - everything comes from `.env`

## Setup Steps

1. Generate the `.env` file (if not already present):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate_env.sh
   ```

2. For VSCode Remote SSH to pick up the environment:
   - **Option A**: Reconnect to the remote session (recommended)
   - **Option B**: Reload the VSCode window

3. Verify the environment is loaded in a new terminal:
   ```bash
   echo $SPACK_VIEW_PATH
   echo $IARA_DIR
   ```

## Notes

- The `.env` file is machine-specific and generated by `scripts/generate_env.sh`
- All paths adapt automatically to different machines
- CMake and other extensions will inherit the environment from the sourced shell
